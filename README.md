##Getting-and-Cleaning-Data: Course project
=========================
###Introduction

This repository includes my work for the course project of "Getting and Cleaning Data", one of  the Data Scienceâ€™s track courses, in coursera. 

Besides this README.md file (describing how the script works), the repository contains a R code file "run_analysis.R" (a code book  in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory),  a tidy dataset "results.txt" and a code book "CodeBook.md" describing the variables. 

###About the project
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

###About the R script and the tidy dataset 
The R script file "run_analysis.R" is written to clean up, merge and transform  the raw data for the project. Through  
"run_analysis.R", the tidy dataset "results.txt" is created.  Details of the process is explained in "CodeBook.md". 

###About the code book
The code book "CodeBook.md"  describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
