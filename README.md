##Getting-and-Cleaning-Data: Course project
=========================
###Introduction

This repository includes my work for the course project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course, one of  the Data Scienceâ€™s track courses, in coursera. 

Besides this README.md file (describing how the script works), the repository contains a R code file "run_analysis.R" (a code book  in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory),  and a code book describing the variables.
